# TCEng Image Build Metadata

This directory contains configuration, provisioning, and metadata related to building Azure images for the TCEng (Taskcluster Engineering) team.

---

## 📁 Directory Structure

- `config/tceng/`  
  YAML files defining metadata and configurations for each image set (e.g. `generic-worker-win2022-staging.yaml`).

- `scripts/windows/tceng/`  
  PowerShell bootstrap scripts for Windows images. These are run by Packer during provisioning.

- `scripts/linux/tceng/`  
  Bootstrap scripts for Linux-based image builds.

---

## ✏️ Ownership and Access

The **TCEng team has direct write access** to the following directories:
- `config/tceng/`
- `scripts/windows/tceng/`
- `scripts/linux/tceng/`

These directories house image definitions and platform-specific bootstrap logic maintained by TCEng.

## 🔐 Authorized User Enforcement

Access to the [TCEng image build workflow](https://github.com/mozilla-platform-ops/worker-images/blob/RELOPS-1640/.github/workflows/nonsig-tceng-azure.yml) is **restricted by GitHub Actions**. Before executing the workflow, the following file is used to authorize users:

- [`tceng.json`](https://github.com/mozilla-platform-ops/worker-images/blob/RELOPS-1640/.github/tceng.json)  
  This file contains a list of GitHub usernames permitted to trigger TCEng image builds. 

### 🔎 How it works:

At the beginning of the `nonsig-tceng-azure.yml` workflow:
- The actor who triggers the workflow (`github.actor`) is checked against both:
  - `.github/tceng.json`
  - `.github/relsre.json`
- If their username is not present in either file, the job fails early with an "unauthorized" message.

To add or remove access, submit a PR modifying `tceng.json`.

## 🔒 Requires Pull Request (PR)

The following files and directories are shared infrastructure and require a **PR submission and review** for changes:

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**  
  `.github/workflows/nonsig-tceng-azure.yml`  
  Defines how TCEng images are built in CI using GitHub Actions.

- **Access Control List**  
  `.github/tceng.json`  
  Defines which GitHub users are authorized to trigger the workflow.

- **Image Build Script**  
  `bin/WorkerImages/Public/New-AzWorkerImage.ps1`  
  PowerShell module function used to parse image YAMLs and launch a Packer build.

- **Packer HCL Template**  
  `packer/tceng-azure.pkr.hcl`  
  Contains the Packer source and build configuration for non-SIG Azure image builds.

If you need to change how images are built or who can trigger them, submit a PR modifying these files.
